-  text: "Proposed hypothesis to RA onset. Under the influence of risk factors such as genetics and environmental exposures, epigenetic remodeling took place in multiple cell types involving signature pathways like SUMOylation, RUNX2, YAP1, NOTCH3, and Î²-Catenin Pathways. The signature TFs drive a characteristic set of pro-inflammatory genes in receiver cells that can, in turn, contribute to the onset and perpetuation of RA. Diverse cell types and pathogenic mechanisms can drive a common clinical phenotype known as RA and could explain the wide variation in clinical response to agents that target individual cytokines or cell types"
