-  text: "Proposed hypothesis to RA onset. Under the influence of risk factors such as genetics and environmental exposures, epigenetic remodeling took place in multiple cell types involving signature pathways like SUMOylation, RUNX2, YAP1, NOTCH3, and Î²-Catenin Pathways. The signature TFs drive a characteristic set of pro-inflammatory genes in receiver cells that can, in turn, contribute to the onset and perpetuation of RA. Diverse cell types and pathogenic mechanisms can drive a common clinical phenotype known as RA and could explain the wide variation in clinical response to agents that target individual cytokines or cell types"

-  text: "PageRank scores heatmap of all TFs across all pseudo-bulk clusters. Labeled TFs are top 10 TFs from each Kmeans group. Clusters in columns are ordered by Kmeans group and their disease states are labeled with two color palettes. The first palette is red for Early RA, yellow for At-Risk, and green for controls. The second is green for CON and orange for At-Risk/ERA. Color of the cell indicates the normalized PageRank scores with red displaying high scores. Each Kmeans group displayed distinct dynamic patterns of TF activity. G2 has the largest number of specific TFs."
